# BlazorDemo.com
This is a web application written for Blazor WebAssembly and demonstrates the
rapid software development that is possible with Microsoft Blazor.

The application serves as a showcase for my Blazor programming work.
I've personally developed all the components featured on this site,
and it is entirely constructed using C# and JavaScript without the use of 
external frameworks.

It includes some pretty sophisticated components like the TabComponent, 
where a dropdown menu is displayed when there isn't enough space to display
all the tab items on the tab bar.

The application is running on https://www.blazordemo.com
